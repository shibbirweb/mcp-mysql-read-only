   * true; this is what says so out loud, and a client that never hears it has
   * to treat `run_query` as if it might drop a table.
   *
   * `openWorldHint` is true throughout because the answers come from a MySQL
   * server, not from a closed set this process controls.
   *
   * All four hints are stated explicitly, including the two the specification
   * treats as meaningful only when `readOnlyHint` is false. An omitted hint is
   * indistinguishable from an unconsidered one: a client, a directory or an
   * auditor reading a partial set cannot tell "this tool is not destructive"
   * from "nobody said". Spelling out the redundant pair costs two lines and
   * removes that ambiguity.
   *
   * Abstract, with no default. This used to be a default here that nine tools
   * inherited, which was correct on the wire but invisible in each tool's own
   * file: directory scanners that read source (M8ven among them) reported
   * all twelve tools as missing every hint. Each tool now states its own four
   * next to its name, so the file a reviewer opens is the whole answer, and the
   * `ToolHints` type makes leaving one out a compile error rather than a CI
